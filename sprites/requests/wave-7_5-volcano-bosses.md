Cindermourn, the Ember Wraith · Idle, Move, Cast · 8 poses, 4 × 2 · 1536x1024 · core

Attach: style_hero, style_centaur

```
Create ONE sprite sheet image for a 2D top-down action RPG called Zeldara.
Reference image 1 = the hero boy (art style, proportions, outline weight, teal highlights). Reference image 2 = the teal-maned centaur (art style for creatures: teal highlight shapes, magenta rim light, glowing eyes and weapon).
Subject: Cindermourn, the Ember Wraith — A hooded wraith of smoke with ember eyes. Details: head: wraith, off: flame, armor: rags, cape: tattered. Main colours: dark red (#5a2a1a), dark red (#2a1008), orange (#ff9040), yellow (#ffe060). Size: about 3.5× the height of the hero (a towering boss).
How it behaves in the game (for the poses): Drifts at you in swirling sparks.
Layout: exactly 8 poses in a grid of 4 columns × 2 rows, evenly spaced, in this order (left to right, top row first):
1. standing at rest, relaxed and alert.
2. the same stance with a small breathing motion (chest raised, weight shifted).
3. movement cycle frame 1: leading limb forward, weight landing.
4. movement cycle frame 2: limbs passing, body at its highest.
5. movement cycle frame 3: the other limb forward, weight landing.
6. movement cycle frame 4: limbs passing the other way.
7. casting wind-up: gathering glowing energy, arms / antennae raised — used for: basic attack.
8. casting release: energy bursting outward from the body in a ring of light.
View: side view facing RIGHT, camera slightly above — a top-down RPG side view (the game mirrors it for left).
Art style (match the attached reference images exactly): bold hand-drawn cartoon game sprite, NOT pixel art and NOT 3D. Thick, confident dark outlines (near-black, heavier on the outer silhouette, thinner inside). Flat cel shading with 2–3 clean tones per material, no soft gradients, no painterly texture, no noise. Chunky chibi proportions: big head, compact body, oversized hands, boots and weapons, strong readable silhouette. SIGNATURE: bright teal / cyan highlights (#3fe6f2) as crisp shapes on the upper-left edges of hair, fur, cloth and metal, as if lit by teal rune-light, plus a thin magenta-violet rim (#c04be0) on the lower-right shadow edges. Magic, eyes of magical creatures, runes and enchanted weapons glow white-cyan with a soft teal halo. Saturated but limited palette. Light comes from the upper left.
Rules: the same character in every pose — identical proportions, outfit, colours and line weight. Every pose drawn at the same scale with the feet (or lowest point) on the same ground line in each cell. Each pose sits fully inside its own cell with clear empty space on all sides; nothing crosses into a neighbouring cell. No ground shadow, no floor, no scenery, no frame, no grid lines, no numbers, no labels, no text, no watermark.
Background: fully transparent (real alpha channel). If you cannot produce real transparency, use one flat solid green #00FF00 background with no texture, no gradient and no checkerboard pattern.

Rules: the same character in every pose — identical proportions, outfit, colours and line weight. Every pose drawn at the same scale with the feet (or lowest point) on the same ground line in each cell. Each pose sits fully inside its own cell with clear empty space on all sides; nothing crosses into a neighbouring cell. No ground shadow, no floor, no scenery, no frame, no grid lines, no numbers, no labels, no text, no watermark.
Background: fully transparent (real alpha channel). If you cannot produce real transparency, use one flat solid green #00FF00 background with no texture, no gradient and no checkerboard pattern.

Create ONE sprite sheet image for a 2D top-down action RPG called Zeldara.
Reference image 1 = the hero boy (art style, proportions, outline weight, teal highlights). Reference image 2 = the teal-maned centaur (art style for creatures: teal highlight shapes, magenta rim light, glowing eyes and weapon).
Subject: Skorrath, the Lava Wyrm — A wingless fire-drake. Details: beast: dragon. Main colours: red (#8a2a10), dark red (#3a0a04), orange (#ffc040), orange (#ffa030). Size: about 3.8× the height of the hero (a towering boss).
How it behaves in the game (for the poses): Lunges out of the lava.
Layout: exactly 8 poses in a grid of 4 columns × 2 rows, evenly spaced, in this order (left to right, top row first):
1. standing at rest, relaxed and alert.
2. the same stance with a small breathing motion (chest raised, weight shifted).
3. movement cycle frame 1: leading limb forward, weight landing.
4. movement cycle frame 2: limbs passing, body at its highest.
5. movement cycle frame 3: the other limb forward, weight landing.
6. movement cycle frame 4: limbs passing the other way.
7. melee wind-up: weapon / claw / jaw drawn back, body coiled — used for: basic attack.
8. melee strike: full extension at the moment of impact, with a short teal-white swing arc.
View: three-quarter view facing down-and-RIGHT, camera slightly above, like the attached centaur reference turned to face right (the game mirrors it for left).
Art style (match the attached reference images exactly): bold hand-drawn cartoon game sprite, NOT pixel art and NOT 3D. Thick, confident dark outlines (near-black, heavier on the outer silhouette, thinner inside). Flat cel shading with 2–3 clean tones per material, no soft gradients, no painterly texture, no noise. Chunky chibi proportions: big head, compact body, oversized hands, boots and weapons, strong readable silhouette. SIGNATURE: bright teal / cyan highlights (#3fe6f2) as crisp shapes on the upper-left edges of hair, fur, cloth and metal, as if lit by teal rune-light, plus a thin magenta-violet rim (#c04be0) on the lower-right shadow edges.

Reference image 2 = the teal-maned centaur (art style for creatures: teal highlight shapes, magenta rim light, glowing eyes and weapon). Reference image 3 = the first approved sheet of this same character: keep the character identical to it.
Subject: Vathrax, the Inferno Wraith — A crowned wraith wreathed in fire and chains. Details: head: wraith, gear: spikecrown, weapon: whip, off: chains, armor: shadow, cape: flame. Main colours: red (#8a2a1a), dark red (#3a0a08), red (#ff6020), yellow (#ffe060). Size: about 4.2× the height of the hero (a towering boss).
How it behaves in the game (for the poses): Hurls fire and drifts through walls of flame.
Layout: exactly 6 poses in a grid of 3 columns × 2 rows, evenly spaced, in this order (left to right, top row first):
1. hurt: flinching backward, eyes shut, a few white impact sparks.
2. enraged roar: head back, mouth wide, body flushed and bristling — used for: phase roar.
3. transformation: doubled over, cracks of light breaking through the body — used for: changes to the next phase.
4. transformation: bursting upward in a pillar of light, new shape forming.
5. death frame 1: buckling, losing balance.
6. death frame 2: collapsed flat on the ground, still.
View: side view facing RIGHT, camera slightly above — a top-down RPG side view (the game mirrors it for left).
Art style (match the attached reference images exactly): bold hand-drawn cartoon game sprite, NOT pixel art and NOT 3D. Thick, confident dark outlines (near-black, heavier on the outer silhouette, thinner inside). Flat cel shading with 2–3 clean tones per material, no soft gradients, no painterly texture, no noise. Chunky chibi proportions: big head, compact body, oversized hands, boots and weapons, strong readable silhouette. SIGNATURE: bright teal / cyan highlights (#3fe6f2) as crisp shapes on the upper-left edges of hair, fur, cloth and metal, as if lit by teal rune-light, plus a thin magenta-violet rim (#c04be0) on the lower-right shadow edges. Magic, eyes of magical creatures, runes and enchanted weapons glow white-cyan with a soft teal halo. Saturated but limited palette. Light comes from the upper left.
Rules: the same character in every pose — identical proportions, outfit, colours and line weight. Every pose drawn at the same scale with the feet (or lowest point) on the same ground line in each cell. Each pose sits fully inside its own cell with clear empty space on all sides; nothing crosses into a neighbouring cell. No ground shadow, no floor, no scenery, no frame, no grid lines, no numbers, no labels, no text, no watermark.
Background: fully transparent (real alpha channel). If you cannot produce real transparency, use one flat solid green #00FF00 background with no texture, no gradient and no checkerboard pattern.
